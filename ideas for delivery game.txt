ideas for delivery game


- level with items that spawn on NPC cars:
	- destroy them to grab the item


- level where u pick up trash and deliver it to a specific location


- car shoots gun turret

- enemies have life and take multiple hits
	- knockups and damage are separate
	- taking damage as a external component

- compete with another delivery car


####
WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY

- stage progression
- destructible NPC cars
- damaging hazards (spikes)
- enemy cars
- tank special unit
- gun turret (player, enemy or hazard)
- sound effects
- camera effects (shake, zoom)
- pause menu
- gameover menu
- cutscenes

WHAT WE SHOULD DO NEXT

- design 1 levels with nothing
- design 3 levels with spikes
- design 5 levels with npc cars and spikes (run over all the cars)
- design 5 levels with npcs carrying items and spikes (run over car, pick up the item and deliver it)
